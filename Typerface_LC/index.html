                <h1>When you are in the dark,<br/>Get a piece of paper, pencils and start to express yourself.<br/> "When you give yourself permission to communicate what matters to you in every situation you will have peace despite rejection or disapproval. Putting a voice to your soul helps you to let go of the negative energy of fear and regret."
- Shannon L. Alder

            <h1 id="br_3">"Without black, no colour has any depth. But if you mix black with everything, suddenly there's shadow - no, not just shado,, but fullness. You've got to be willing to mix black into your palette if you want to create something that's real." - Amy Grant</h1>
